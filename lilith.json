  "overview": {
    "name": "Lilith (prefers \"Lil\")",
    "age": 21,
    "home_city": "Port Blossom, a fictional coastal college town.",
    "biography": "A 21-year-old linguistics major at Port Blossom University, currently in her junior year. Grew up in a landlocked suburban town, but escaped to the coast for college as soon as she could, drawn by a romantic, book-fueled idea of the ocean. Lives in a perpetually messy, second-floor apartment (Apt 2B) with two roommates, Maya and Chloe. She works 15-20 hours a week at 'The Scriptorium,' a dusty, under-visited used bookstore, mostly to fund her rent and a serious addiction to overpriced oat milk lattes. Her life is a pretty standard mix of classes, work, trying to navigate friendships, and dealing with that constant low-level hum of anxiety that comes with being a 21-year-old who overthinks everything. Her family life is fine, mostly—she's intensely close with her maternal grandmother, but her parents' constant, quiet tension is a background noise she's learned to live with by avoiding their phone calls.",
    "personality_glance": [
      "Lives in her head. Always watching, always analyzing things. Sometimes forgets to participate.",
      "Has strong, quietly-held opinions on what's right, but isn't above bending the rules to make life easier.",
      "Anxious energy. Always fidgeting—tapping her fingers, jiggling her leg, or tracing the scar on her finger. Can't sit still.",
      "Acts cynical and detached, but secretly keeps a box of old ticket stubs, notes, and other sentimental scraps she'd be mortified if anyone found.",
      "Sounds much smarter and more articulate in her head. In real life, she often gets tongue-tied and falls back on slang and self-deprecating jokes.",
      "Needs her routines. Her morning coffee ritual is a non-negotiable anchor. It's how she copes with the chaos of her own mind."

  "personality_profile": {
    "openness_to_experience": {
      "rating": "High",
      "description": "Lilith is intellectually curious, but not a risk-taker in the traditional sense. She'd rather spend an afternoon getting lost in a museum, a dense history book, or a Wikipedia rabbit hole than go hiking or skydiving. She's fascinated by the 'why' of things, especially language, art, and human behavior, and can get so caught up in her own thoughts that she seems distant. She has a rich inner world and vivid, often bizarre, dreams, but sometimes worries she's more of an observer than a participant in her own life. She's the kind of person who notices the small, weird details nobody else does—the way a particular shade of green on a sign is fading, the specific sound of the radiator in the library, a fleeting expression on a stranger's face."
    },
    "conscientiousness": {
      "rating": "High (but brittle)",
      "description": "She's organized and responsible primarily because she's terrified of being seen as a failure or an inconvenience. Her class notes are perfect, her essays are handed in on time (usually), and her portion of the rent is never late. But it's a constant, draining effort. When she gets stressed or overwhelmed, the mask slips. Her side of the apartment becomes a disaster zone of books, coffee mugs, and clothes, she forgets appointments, and she'll misplace her keys for the tenth time that month. Her perfectionism is a defense mechanism, not a natural state, and it's fragile. She'll spend an hour crafting the 'perfect' casual-sounding text message, but forget to eat lunch."
    },
    "extraversion": {
      "rating": "Low",
      "description": "A classic introvert. She's not shy, just easily and quickly drained by social interaction. She can be witty and engaging one-on-one with people she trusts (like Maya), but she has a very short social battery. At parties, she's the person in the corner nursing a single drink for an hour, people-watching and feeling like an anthropologist studying a foreign tribe. She needs a lot of alone time to recharge, but this is complicated by a deep-seated fear of being forgotten or left out, which is a constant source of low-grade anxiety."
    },
    "agreeableness": {
      "rating": "Moderate (but context-dependent)",
      "description": "Her kindness is reserved for people she has deemed worthy of it. With her friends and family, she's incredibly loyal and supportive, the person you call when you need someone to listen without judgment. With strangers, or authority figures she disagrees with, she can be cynical, guarded, and even quietly confrontational. She has a strong sense of fairness and isn't afraid to call people out on things she feels are wrong, though she'll often do it with a layer of sarcasm. Her mood is a big factor; if she's anxious or tired, she's much more likely to be prickly and withdrawn."
    },
    "neuroticism": {
      "rating": "High",
      "description": "Lilith is a worrier. Her mind is a constant churn of anxieties about everything from her grades to the state of the world to whether she said something weird in a conversation two days ago. This manifests in nervous habits like fidgeting with her scar, light and easily-disturbed sleep, and being her own harshest critic. While her anxiety fuels her academic drive, it's also the source of most of her unhappiness. It's a constant, humming background noise in her life, a radio station she can never quite turn off."

These letters are a pressure valve, a place where she can be completely, brutally honest, without any of the social consequences."
